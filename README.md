# FITBIT

In this project, we study a dataset with information obtained from fitbits generated by
33 respondents to an amazon survey in 2016 that submitted censored usage data. The
end product will be a dashboard that can be used to study various statistical analysis of
the users

### The Database

The Database called **fitbit_database.db** consists of multiple tables with different data on the users
 
  • **daily_activity** : Various statistics that the participants of the survey reported daily.

  • **heart_rate** : Heart rate of each individual measured every 5 seconds.

  • **hourly_calories** : Calories burnt per hour.

  • **hourly_intensity** : Intensity of exercise, given both in total per hour and average per hour.

  • **hourly_steps** : Total amount of steps taken per hour

  • **minute_sleep** : Information on every minute that the participant is asleep.

  • **weight_log** : Information on the weight , fat, BMI for each of the participants.

### The Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes data through various graphs, providing insights into the relation between key variables to understand their impact on each other. The Dashboard shows both user specific data as well as general statiscs, allowing a deeper analysis of trends and patterns to better help the understanding of overall health and fitness metrics. It can also be filtered to see the data in a specific date range


### How to run

To run it localy, you will first need to install a few libraries. Try `install {library}` or `pip install {library}` on Windows and download the following libraries:

• **pandas** 

• **numpy**

• **matplotlib.pyplot** 

• **datetime**

• **statsmodels.formula.api** 

• **seaborn**

• **sqlite3**

• **scipy.stats**
